# Emergency Services Project - Custodia Emergency

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of an Android application and a website for emergency services. The primary aim is to enable passersby to trigger an emergency alert with a double-tap from the lock screen. This alert sends essential information to designated emergency contacts and initiates a '911' call. Additionally, we have plans for future enhancements, including the integration of a database. This database will allow caregivers and medical professionals to add crucial emergency and medical information to the app on behalf of the user.

## Android Application

- **Development Environment**: We utilized **Android Studio** to create the Android application. Android Studio provides a robust development environment for building native Android apps.

- **Frontend Prototyping**: For the initial design and prototyping of the Android app's user interface, we leveraged **FlutterFlow**. FlutterFlow allowed us to quickly create interactive UI mockups and iterate on the design before moving on to full-fledged development.

## Website

- **Development Environment**: The website component of this project was developed using **Visual Studio**, which offers a versatile environment for web development.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to:

- Complete the implementation of the Android application and website.
- Integrate a database system to allow caregivers and medical professionals to add vital emergency and medical information to the app for the user's benefit.
